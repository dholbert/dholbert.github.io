        This lime region has "height:100%". If that's honored, no red
        will be visible.

        (Note that my containing block -- the red region -- has
        'height:auto', which might seem like something we can't resolve
        percentages against. Still, its height clearly does not depend
        on content, because it's being stretched (due to 'align-self:stretch')
        inside of a single-line horizontal flex container with a fixed height.)

  As of Feb 5th, 2014, these browsers show only lime (i.e. they honor
  the percent height):
  <ul>
    <li>Firefox Nightly (ver 30)</li>
    <li>IE (ver 11)</li>
  </ul>
  ...and these browsers show a bunch of red (i.e. they don't honor
  the percent height):
  <ul>
    <li>Chrome (ver 32.0.1685.0 dev)</li>
    <li>Opera with Presto (ver 12.16)</li>
