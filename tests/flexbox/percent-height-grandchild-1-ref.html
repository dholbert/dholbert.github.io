        (Note that my containing block -- the red region -- <b>also</b> has
        'height:100%', which may or may not be resolvable as an explicit
        height for us to resolve <b>our</b> 100% against (depending on how
        its own containing block is sized.))

  <p>
  As of Feb 5th, 2014, all browsers I've tested render this without any red;
  the lime region ends up 400px tall. This is uncontroversial and is
  purely for comparison against
  <a href="http://people.mozilla.org/~dholbert/tests/flexbox/compat_tests/percent-height-grandchild-1.html">this other testcase</a>.
